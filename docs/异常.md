# 异常

## 语法

```python
try:
    print(5/0)
except  ZeroDivisionError:  #ZeroDivisionError 具体的错误类型
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
```

## 使用异常避免崩溃

else代码块

```python
print("Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.")
print("Enter 'q' to quit.")
while True:
    first_number = input("\nFirst number: ") if first_number == 'q':
    break
    second_number = input("Second number: ")
    try:
        answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("You can't divide by 0!")
    else:
        print(answer)
```

处理FileNotFoundError 异常

```python
filename = 'a.txt'
try:
    with open(filename) as f_obj:
        contents = f_obj.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        msg = "Sorry, the file " + filename + " does not exist."
        print(msg)
```

失败时一声不吭 pass

```python
filename = 'a.txt'
try:
    with open(filename) as f_obj:
        contents = f_obj.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    else:
        print(contents)
```
